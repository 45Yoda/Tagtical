      Technology is being used more and more in the various activities of everyday life.
      Sports aren't no exception to the rule and everyday there are more cases of technology incorporated in sports,
      such as: the line goal used in various sports and more recently the introduction of VAR on football.

      This evolution doens't only happen just on the game but on the training too, where the gathering and analysis 
      of the data allow the trainer to get a better comprehension of the player's performance and maximize his potential.

      It's in this field that we want to make a difference. We want gather the data of the players in a single game
      and show it in a way that a trainer can improve his knowledge about his team players and performance.

      This type of technology is already being used in some outdoors sports but we challenge ourselves to bring this to indoor sports too.
